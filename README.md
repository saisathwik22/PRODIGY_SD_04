## Implement a sudoku solver.

Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved 
sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement ofnumbers for 
the puzzle. Once solved the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.

# Sudoku Solver

## Project Overview

üöÄ I'm thrilled to share a recent project I‚Äôve worked on as part of a challenging task at Prodigy InfoTech! üåêüéÆ

This project involves creating a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and uses an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **Backtracking Algorithm:** This algorithm is used to solve the Sudoku puzzle by trying different possibilities and backtracking if a conflict is detected.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementing the solution.

## How It Works

The Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm, which is a depth-first search algorithm that attempts to fill the board one cell at a time. If it encounters a conflict, it backtracks and tries a different number. This process continues until the puzzle is solved or no solution is possible.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Find Empty Cells:** Locate the next empty cell in the Sudoku grid.
2. **Try Possible Numbers:** For each empty cell, attempt to place each number from 1 to 9.
3. **Check for Conflicts:** After placing a number, check if it violates the Sudoku rules (each number must be unique in its row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).
4. **Backtrack if Needed:** If a conflict is detected, backtrack and try the next number.
5. **Repeat:** Continue this process until the puzzle is solved or no solution is found.
